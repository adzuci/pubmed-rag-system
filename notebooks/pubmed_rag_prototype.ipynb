RESULTS: Nine major themes were identified: (1) stepping into the caregiver role and responsibilities; (2) supporting activities of daily living; (3) managing behavioural problems; (4) complex care needs; (5) caregiver-related challenges; 6) healthcare-related challenges; (7) knowledge, perception, and awareness of caregivers; (8) consequences of caregiving; and (9) perceived needs. CONCLUSION: Thematic analyses revealed that the caregiving challenges of dementia caregivers were related to behavioral disturbance, functional care needs, complex care needs, caregiver-related challenges, healthcare-related challenges, understanding of dementia, and stepping into the caregiver role and responsibilities. The consequences of caregiving affect caregivers' physical, psychological, and financial health.\n",

            "This study aimed to describe the daily experiences of family caregivers of individuals with dementia, with the objective of better understanding and addressing their specific needs. METHODS: Qualitative interviews with 11 family caregivers in Sweden. Data were analyzed by inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were identified: (1) Struggling with conflicting emotions and social challenges - caregivers reported experiencing stress, physical exhaustion, and emotional strain due to constant availability and the challenges of managing behavioral changes, further intensified by isolation and shrinking social networks. (2) Balancing autonomy in care decisions - caregivers described the paradox of bearing full responsibility for care decisions despite having limited access to information, and, (3) Dependence on home care and nursing homes that are not adapted to needs - caregivers expressed a reliance on home care and nursing homes, yet noted that these services are often ill-equipped to address the specific demands of dementia care. CONCLUSION: Caring for a family member with dementia reshapes family roles and creates ongoing challenges in balancing safety, well-being, and limited support. This study highlights the need for person- and family-centered care, grounded in the home context and developed in partnership with family caregivers.\n",

            "OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study explored the challenges faced by family caregivers in providing care for PwD and identified the knowledge and skills they need for effective caregiving roles. METHODS: In-depth interviews with 20 family caregivers of PwD were conducted face-to-face using a semi-structured questionnaire at the Department of Geriatrics at Nhan dan Gia Dinh Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Data analysis was conducted using inductive content analysis. The interview transcripts were coded by two independent researchers and analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Six key themes emerged: (1) challenges in daily care; (2) strain from behavioral and sleep disruptions; (3) difficulties in seeking help; (4) personal sacrifices of caregivers; (5) emotional burdens associated with caregiving, including comorbidity concerns of PwD; (6) limited dementia knowledge and essential caregiving skills. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights the need for targeted interventions in dementia care and underscores the necessity of providing educational and support programs for family carers of people with dementia in Vietnam and other low- and middle-income countries.\n",

              "\"Caregiver preparedness gaps in dementia care encompass several key areas. The most common preparedness gaps identified are in care coordination, emotional and social support, and advance planning. Caregivers also express needs in nursing and health monitoring, personal care, mobility assistance, and household tasks.\\n\\nSpecific tasks that caregivers feel less prepared for include managing emotional and behavioral symptoms of dementia patients, recognizing and responding to significant changes in the patient's condition, seeking relevant medical information, handling financial and legal matters, and advocating for services.\\n\\nIt's important to note that these preparedness gaps are not unique to caregivers of dementia patients. Similar proportions of caregivers for veterans with and without dementia reported preparedness needs across various domains and tasks, suggesting that these challenges are common in caregiving for older adults in general. Additionally, research has shown that lack of caregiver availability or capacity to help with medical, functional, or instrumental tasks is associated with higher odds of patients receiving various home health services. This suggests that addressing these caregiver preparedness gaps could potentially reduce the need for some professional services and better support aging in place.\\n\\nUnderstanding these preparedness gaps is crucial for developing targeted interventions and support systems to help caregivers feel more confident and capable in their roles, ultimately improving the quality of care for individuals with dementia and other aging-related conditions.\""
